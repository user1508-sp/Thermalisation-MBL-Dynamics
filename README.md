#1
Autocorrelation time evolution nearest neighbour interaction
* The nearest neighbour interaction model used here is an intergrable system
* We obtain periodic variation of the autocorrelation with time due to this integrability
* This is not disorder averaged yet

#2
AutoCorr_NN_Initial States Average
* Work with the nearest neighbour interaction hamiltonian
* Averages over all initial states 
* The correlation function shows decay
